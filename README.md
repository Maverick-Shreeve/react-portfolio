My goal with this portfolio is just to make something simple and to the point. I feel like a portfolio is not something that needs to be super flashy.
In the past i feel like I had been trying to add to much extra onto my portfolio. I was planning on trying to use some 3d animations in this portfolio but once i saw an example of a simple and straightforward porfolio i knew its definently what i wanted to make.
